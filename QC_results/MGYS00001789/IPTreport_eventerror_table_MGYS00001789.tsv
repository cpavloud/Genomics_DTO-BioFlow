5	Empty value for required field eventDate	MGYA00199487	This sample (TARA_A100000551) was collected in the marine biome (ENVO:00000447) during Tara Oceans expedition on date/time=2009-11-18T08:41Z at station TARA_023 (latitudeN=42.2038, longitudeE=17.715) from a surface water (ENVO:00002042) layer at a depth of 3-7 m, using a PUMP (High Volume Peristaltic Pump).  The sample material (particulate matter, including plankton (ENVO:xxxxxxxx)) was size-fractionated (0.8-5 micrometres) and preserved on board  in liquid nitrogen for later phylogenetic analysis of protist (unicellular eukaryote) nucleotide sequences identification by pyrosequencing methods.		5	5	42.2038	17.715	{"temperature":"17.32198","project name":"Tara Oceans","geographic location (longitude)":"17.715","environment (biome)":"marine biome (ENVO:00000447)","environment (feature)":"surface water (ENVO:00002042) layer","environment (material)":"particulate matter, including plankton (ENVO:xxxxxxxx)","environmental package":"water","sample collection device or method":"PUMP (High Volume Peristaltic Pump)","salinity":"38.201397","geographic location (latitude)":"42.2038","instrument model":"Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx","ENA checklist":"ERC000030"}	1409544	DNA sequence reads	https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/samples/ERS477988
